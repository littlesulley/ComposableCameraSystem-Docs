# Transitions

A transition is a **pose-only blender**. Each frame of its lifetime it receives two input poses — the source pose (what the player was just seeing) and the target pose (what the player is heading toward) — and produces one output pose. That's the whole contract.

A transition never holds a pointer to the cameras it's blending. It never knows which directors are involved. It cannot reach up into the Context Stack. It works entirely from poses and a bit of initialization data. This is deliberate and is what makes transitions universally reusable — the same `InertializedTransition` instance blends gameplay-to-cutscene, cutscene-to-gameplay, or one gameplay camera to another, with no special cases.

## Lifecycle

Every transition has four phases:

```
TransitionEnabled(InitParams)   — once, when the tree gets rewritten
OnBeginPlay()                    — once, on the first Evaluate frame
OnEvaluate()                     — every frame thereafter
OnFinished()                     — once, when RemainingTime ≤ 0
```

- **`TransitionEnabled(InitParams)`** fires the moment the transition is first wired into a tree inner node (see [Evaluation Tree](evaluation-tree.md#how-the-tree-grows-when-you-activate-a-camera)). It receives a small struct describing the world state *at the instant the transition was created*, not at the first frame it evaluates.
- **`OnBeginPlay()`** fires just before the first `OnEvaluate()`. Transitions use it to set up internal state that depends on the live source/target cameras — spline control points derived from both poses, polynomial coefficients for inertialization, and so on.
- **`OnEvaluate()`** fires every subsequent frame. It receives the *live* source and target poses (re-evaluated every frame) and the current `Percentage` (0 → 1 over `TransitionDuration`), and returns the blended pose.
- **`OnFinished()`** fires once when `RemainingTime` drops to zero. The inner node that owns this transition will be collapsed on the same frame (see [Evaluation Tree → collapse rule](evaluation-tree.md#the-collapse-rule-why-trees-stay-small)).

## InitParams — why velocity matters

`FComposableCameraTransitionInitParams` is the snapshot passed to `TransitionEnabled` and carried into `OnBeginPlay`. It contains:

- **`CurrentSourcePose`** — the blended output the player was just seeing (the Director's `LastEvaluatedPose`).
- **`PreviousSourcePose`** — what the player saw the frame before (the Director's `PreviousEvaluatedPose`).
- **`DeltaTime`** — the frame delta at the moment of creation.

Velocity-aware transitions — inertialization, path-guided, any custom physically-plausible blender — need these two poses. Initial velocity is `(Current - Previous) / DeltaTime`. Without it, a blend that starts while the source camera is mid-motion would appear to "kink" at the start as velocity discontinuously snaps to zero.

Transitions that don't care about velocity (linear, cubic, smooth) can ignore InitParams entirely.

## The five-tier resolution chain

When the PCM is asked to switch from camera A (built from `SourceTypeAsset`) to camera B (built from `TargetTypeAsset`), it needs to pick **which transition to run**. `AComposableCameraPlayerCameraManager::ResolveTransition` walks a five-tier priority chain; the first tier that produces a non-null transition wins.

1. **Caller-supplied override** — whatever you passed to `TransitionOverride` on the activation call (`ActivateCamera`, `ActivateComposableCameraFromTypeAsset`, `PopCameraContext`, `TerminateCurrentCamera`). Always wins. Use this when a specific gameplay event needs a specific blend regardless of the cameras involved.

2. **Transition table lookup** — the project-wide `UComposableCameraTransitionTableDataAsset` declared in *Project Settings → ComposableCameraSystem → TransitionTable*. Holds an array of `(SourceTypeAsset, TargetTypeAsset, Transition)` triples. Performs **exact-match only** on the pair; first matching entry in declaration order wins. There are intentionally no wildcards.

3. **Source's `ExitTransition`** — declared on `SourceTypeAsset`. "Whenever this camera leaves, blend out like this, regardless of target."
	![[assets/images/Pasted image 20260416203631.png]]
4. **Target's `EnterTransition`** — declared on `TargetTypeAsset`. "Whenever this camera is activated, blend in like this, regardless of source."
	![[assets/images/Pasted image 20260416203648.png]]
5. **Hard cut** — no transition resolved; the new camera appears instantly and the tree is replaced (no inner node is created).

!!! note "Why no wildcards in the table"
    It's tempting to want `(AnyCamera, CutsceneA) → SpecialBlend`. But once wildcards exist, they tend to shadow the per-camera `EnterTransition`/`ExitTransition` defaults silently — now every author needs to remember whether a wildcard exists before setting their camera's default transition. Per-camera `ExitTransition` (tier 3) and `EnterTransition` (tier 4) cover the common "always leave/enter this camera a certain way" intent without that footgun. The table stays reserved for explicit pair-specific routing.

The resolution call is identical for in-context activations (inside one context) and inter-context pops (across a context boundary). If you add an entry to the transition table for `(CutsceneA, Gameplay)`, it will fire on the pop from a cutscene context back to gameplay.

## Built-in transitions

| Transition | Shape |
|---|---|
| `LinearTransition` | Straight linear interpolation of the pose. |
| `CubicTransition` | Cubic easing, smooth start and end. |
| `EaseTransition` | `EaseInOut` with a tunable exponent. |
| `SmoothTransition` | Hermite smoothstep `t²(3-2t)` or smoother-step `t³(t(6t-15)+10)`. |
| `CylindricalTransition` | Arc around a pivot derived from ray intersection — good for orbital feels. |
| `InertializedTransition` | Velocity-aware 5th-order polynomial blends for position and rotation. Optional auto-computed duration from a max-acceleration bound. Optional additive curve for shape control. |
| `SplineTransition` | Camera follows a computed spline (Hermite, Bezier, Catmull-Rom, or Arc) with configurable evaluation curves. |
| `PathGuidedTransition` | Three-phase (inertialized enter → follow a rail → inertialized exit), using an intermediate camera on the rail. Good for cinematic swoops. |
| `DynamicDeocclusionTransition` | Wrapper over another transition; scales blend weight down when the target would be occluded, up when clear. |

See the [Reference → Transitions](../../reference/transitions.md) catalog for details on each.

## Pose-only, restated

Because transitions never touch cameras or Directors, these things all work with any transition type without extra plumbing:

- blending in the middle of a context,
- blending across a context pop,
- stacking blends (the source might itself be a blend in progress — the transition's left input is just a pose either way),
- pausing the source camera's node evaluation — the transition wouldn't notice as long as it still gets a pose.

This is also why authoring a new transition is a small, self-contained task. Your `OnEvaluate` receives two poses and a blend percentage, and returns a pose. Everything else — tree rewriting, collapse, cross-context fan-out — is the system's job. See [Extending → Custom Transitions](../../extending/custom-transitions.md).
