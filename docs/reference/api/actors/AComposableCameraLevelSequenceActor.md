Actor dedicated to binding composable cameras into a Level Sequence.

**Structure**

RootComponent = UCineCameraComponent (OutputCineCameraComponent) ← viewport terminal Sibling = [UComposableCameraLevelSequenceComponent](../uobjects-other/UComposableCameraLevelSequenceComponent.md#ucomposablecameralevelsequencecomponent) ← logic/data driver

Mirrors ACineCameraActor's shape: the CineCamera is the Actor's root component, so every native UE path ("find a UCameraComponent on this
actor", Camera Cut Track, viewport Pilot, Sequencer's Camera Cut target resolution) lands on it immediately. PCM::SetViewTarget's implicit- activation filter hits its root-is-camera fast path identical to how it handles CineCameraActor.

The LevelSequenceComponent is a plain UActorComponent (no transform) — it holds the TypeAssetReference bag and drives the internal CCS camera, projecting each tick's pose onto the CineCamera.

**Placement**

Placeable in the level (Place Actors panel) AND usable as a Sequencer Spawnable / Possessable. The latter two paths remain the most common — the Sequencer Spawnable binding spawns the actor on section entry and destroys it on exit; a Possessable binds an existing in-level instance. Direct level placement is supported for designers who want to author a camera against a Sequencer that always exists in the level (e.g. an in-level cinematic trigger that drives the same actor every play).

Without an active Sequencer driving the LevelSequenceComponent, a free-standing instance is a no-op (see [UComposableCameraLevelSequenceComponent::SetEvaluationEnabled](../uobjects-other/UComposableCameraLevelSequenceComponent.md#setevaluationenabled) — the component still ticks, but with no Shot / Patch overrides to apply it just projects the InternalCamera's default pose). This is by design; the actor doesn't error on a "lonely" instance.

**Runtime driver**

All real work lives on the LevelSequenceComponent — the actor has no per-frame responsibilities of its own.

### Public Methods

| Return | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
|  | [`AComposableCameraLevelSequenceActor`](#acomposablecameralevelsequenceactor-1)  |  |

#### AComposableCameraLevelSequenceActor { #acomposablecameralevelsequenceactor-1 }

```cpp
AComposableCameraLevelSequenceActor(const FObjectInitializer & ObjectInitializer)
```

### Protected Attributes

| Return | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `TObjectPtr< UCineCameraComponent >` | [`OutputCineCameraComponent`](#outputcinecameracomponent)  | Output viewport-terminal CineCamera. Same component the actor's inherited `RootComponent` field points at — the dedicated `UPROPERTY` here surfaces it in the Details panel's Components tree so designers can author per-instance lens / filmback / aperture / post-process / focus settings (all the standard `UCineCameraComponent` properties). Without an explicit `UPROPERTY`, the native default subobject still exists at runtime but isn't picked up by the Details panel's component-tree walk, so its internals would render uneditable. |
| `TObjectPtr< UComposableCameraLevelSequenceComponent >` | [`LevelSequenceComponent`](#levelsequencecomponent)  | Logic-and-data driver ActorComponent. Holds the TypeAssetReference (TypeAsset + Parameters / Variables bags), spawns the transient internal CCS camera each tick, and projects the resulting pose onto the CineCamera root component. Not the Actor's root — the CineCamera is, so native UCameraComponent lookups resolve immediately. |

#### OutputCineCameraComponent { #outputcinecameracomponent }

```cpp
TObjectPtr< UCineCameraComponent > OutputCineCameraComponent
```

Output viewport-terminal CineCamera. Same component the actor's inherited `RootComponent` field points at — the dedicated `UPROPERTY` here surfaces it in the Details panel's Components tree so designers can author per-instance lens / filmback / aperture / post-process / focus settings (all the standard `UCineCameraComponent` properties). Without an explicit `UPROPERTY`, the native default subobject still exists at runtime but isn't picked up by the Details panel's component-tree walk, so its internals would render uneditable.

`VisibleAnywhere` on the pointer (component identity is fixed — can't reassign to a different component) plus the standard `EditAnywhere` flags on `UCineCameraComponent`'s own UPROPERTYs give the desired surface: pointer is read-only (don't replace the component), but the component's properties are designer-editable.

#### LevelSequenceComponent { #levelsequencecomponent }

```cpp
TObjectPtr< UComposableCameraLevelSequenceComponent > LevelSequenceComponent
```

Logic-and-data driver ActorComponent. Holds the TypeAssetReference (TypeAsset + Parameters / Variables bags), spawns the transient internal CCS camera each tick, and projects the resulting pose onto the CineCamera root component. Not the Actor's root — the CineCamera is, so native UCameraComponent lookups resolve immediately.
