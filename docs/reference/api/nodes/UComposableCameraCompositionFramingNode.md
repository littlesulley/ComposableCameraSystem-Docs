#include <ComposableCameraCompositionFramingNode.h>
```

> **Inherits:** [`UComposableCameraCameraNodeBase`](../uobjects-other/UComposableCameraCameraNodeBase.md#ucomposablecameracameranodebase)

Camera node that wraps the Composition Solver — produces a complete camera pose (Position + Rotation + FOV + Focus + Aperture) from an authored `[FComposableCameraShot](../structs/FComposableCameraShot.md#fcomposablecamerashot)` each tick.

This is the consumer that connects the Phase B Shot data model to the camera evaluation pipeline. See Docs/ShotBasedKeyframing.md §3-4 for the data model + solver pipeline; TechDoc §3.25 for the solver internals.

──** Authoring model (V1)**

The Shot is authored fully in this node's Details panel inside the camera type asset. The struct contains a `TArray<FShotTarget>` which violates the pin data block's POD constraint (TechDoc §3.2), so it is NOT pin-exposable. Phase E's LS Shot Section integration will push Shot data via a separate runtime API (not pin wiring). `GetPinDeclarations` accordingly returns no pins — the node has no inputs to wire and no outputs to pipe; it OWNS the camera pose.

──** Behavior**

Pose-overwriting node. Position + Rotation + FieldOfView + Aperture + FocusDistance are unconditionally written from the solver result when it succeeds. If you want upstream nodes to contribute, place them DOWNSTREAM (after the Composition node), not upstream.

`PhysicalCameraBlendWeight` is forced to 1.0 so the Aperture + FocusDistance written by the solver are actually consumed by the renderer's DoF system. If you don't want physical-camera DoF, follow this node with a downstream node (e.g. a custom one) that sets `PhysicalCameraBlendWeight` back to 0.

`FocalLength` is set to -1 to put the pose in "FOV is authoritative" mode (matches `LensNode::bOverrideFieldOfViewFromFocalLength = true` semantics). Downstream `LensNode` may override.

When `Shot.Placement.PlacementAnchor` or `Shot.Aim.AimAnchor` is unresolvable (spec §5.3 — invalid index, all weights zero, etc.), the node passes the upstream pose through unmodified and the solver logs a warning. Camera doesn't snap; previous frame's pose effectively persists.

──** Patch compatibility**

`Incompatible`. The node's whole purpose is to overwrite the pose; layering a Patch on top of it has no defined semantics. Same classification as `RelativeFixedPoseNode` / `MixingCameraNode`.

──** Bounds-cache lifecycle**

`OnInitialize` refreshes the AutoFromComponentBounds cache for every target with that BoundsShape — covers `StaticSnapshot` policy entirely and seeds Periodic / Live so their first tick uses fresh data.

`OnTickNode` then refreshes per-target according to policy:

* `Live`: refresh every frame.

* `Periodic`: refresh when `LocalFrameCounter % Interval == 0`.

* `StaticSnapshot`: never refresh after OnInitialize.

#### Shot { #shot-2 }

```cpp
FComposableCameraShot Shot
```

Authored Shot — drives the Composition Solver each tick. Edited in the node's Details panel. NOT pin-exposable: `[FComposableCameraShot](../structs/FComposableCameraShot.md#fcomposablecamerashot)` contains a `TArray<FShotTarget>` which violates the pin data block's POD constraint (TechDoc §3.2). Runtime pushes (e.g. from LS Shot Sections in Phase E) mutate this struct via the `SetActiveShotsFromSequencer` API.

`BlueprintReadOnly` per spec §1.4 — Shot data is designer-authored content, not gameplay-controlled state.

In Phase F's two-Shot blend the field is treated as the *primary* (outgoing / lower-row) Shot. The secondary Shot is held in `SecondaryShot` and active iff `bHasSecondaryShot` is true.

#### DrawNodeDebug { #drawnodedebug-14 }

`virtual` `const`

```cpp
virtual void DrawNodeDebug(UWorld * World, bool bViewerIsOutsideCamera) const
```

Called each frame when the `CCS.Debug.Viewport` CVar is enabled, for every node on the currently running camera. Override to draw world-space debug gizmos via `DrawDebugHelpers` (DrawDebugSphere, DrawDebugLine, etc.) that visualise this node's runtime state — e.g. a pivot sphere for PivotOffsetNode, a look-at line for LookAtNode, the collision trace for CollisionPushNode, a sampled spline path for SplineNode.

Access the owning camera via `OwningCamera` and current-frame pin values via the usual `GetInputPinValue<T>()` / member-read path — this hook fires AFTER TickNode, so pin-backed UPROPERTYs still hold the resolved values from the most recent evaluation.

`bViewerIsOutsideCamera` mirrors the ticker's frustum-draw flag: true when the viewer is observing the camera from outside (F8 eject, SIE, or `CCS.Debug.Viewport.AlwaysShow`), false when the player is looking through the camera. Most gizmos (pivot spheres at distant characters, lines to look-at targets, spline polylines far in the world) can ignore this and draw unconditionally. Gizmos that sit AT the camera's own position (e.g. `CollisionPushNode`'s self-collision sphere) should gate on this bool so they don't hermetically seal the player inside the wireframe during live gameplay.

Default implementation does nothing. Compiled out in shipping builds.

#### SetActiveShotsFromSequencer { #setactiveshotsfromsequencer }

```cpp
void SetActiveShotsFromSequencer(const FComposableCameraShot & InPrimaryShot, const FComposableCameraShot * InSecondaryShot, UComposableCameraTransitionDataAsset * InTransition, float InAlpha, bool bPrimaryChanged)
```

Phase F: push the active Shot pair from the LSComponent each frame an override is applied.

InPrimaryShot → written into `Shot` (the V1 primary path). InSecondaryShot → optional incoming Shot (the higher-row of an overlap pair). When non-null AND `InTransition` is non-null, the framing node runs both solvers and blends their poses through the transition using `InAlpha` ∈ [0, 1]. InTransition → resolved transition asset; null = hard cut. The blend pass is skipped — `Shot` (primary) is the sole solver input, matching V1 top-row- winner behavior. InAlpha → secondary's contribution weight ∈ [0, 1]. Clamped defensively. Ignored when `InSecondaryShot` is null or `InTransition` is null. bPrimaryChanged → true iff the LSComponent detected that the active *primary* Section has changed since the previous tick (Section A → Section B with no overlap, Section bind to a different ShotAsset, etc.). Triggers a primary-state reseed (`bHasLastPrimaryOutputPose = false`, `LastPrimaryDistance / FOV / Roll` cleared) so V2.2 damping doesn't carry the previous shot's pose into the new shot's first frame — without this, Distance / FOV / Roll damping would visibly glide between the two shots' poses on every cut. Phase F blend exits already trigger the same reseed independently; this flag covers the non-overlap cut case.

Persistence: the node retains the last-written state across frames. When the LSComponent's override map empties, no further calls happen and the camera holds its last framing — the gap-fill semantic Phase E established and Phase F preserves.

---

#### SetExternalAspectRatioOverride { #setexternalaspectratiooverride }

`inline`

```cpp
inline void SetExternalAspectRatioOverride(float Aspect)
```

Push the effective render aspect ratio for solver use. The node by default queries `GetEffectiveViewportAspectRatio` from `OwningPlayerCameraManager`, which is null in the LS Component path → falls back to either GameViewport (PIE) or editor active viewport. That works for unconstrained CineCams, but with `bConstrainAspectRatio == true` the renderer letterboxes to the filmback-derived aspect regardless of viewport, and the solver needs to match. The LS Component computes the effective aspect via `GetEffectiveAspectRatioForCineCamera(OutputCineCameraComponent)` and pushes it here; OnTickNode prefers the override when > 0.

Set every tick by `[UComposableCameraLevelSequenceComponent::TickComponent](../uobjects-other/UComposableCameraLevelSequenceComponent.md#tickcomponent)` before invoking the solver. PCM-driven path doesn't call this — falls back to the `OwningPlayerCameraManager` query, which is correct for gameplay (PCM has access to PlayerController viewport).

### Public Static Methods

| Return | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `const TSet< TWeakObjectPtr< UComposableCameraCompositionFramingNode > > &` | [`GetActiveInstances`](#getactiveinstances) `static` | Per-process registry of all currently-initialized framing nodes — read by `[FComposableCameraShotZoneOverlay](../structs/FComposableCameraShotZoneOverlay.md#fcomposablecamerashotzoneoverlay)` (the LS / PIE viewport `CCS.Debug.Viewport.ShotZones` overlay) so it can paint anchor + zone gizmos for every active Shot regardless of whether the host camera is on the PCM context stack or owned by an LS Component. |

---

#### GetActiveInstances { #getactiveinstances }

`static`

```cpp
static const TSet< TWeakObjectPtr< UComposableCameraCompositionFramingNode > > & GetActiveInstances()
```

Per-process registry of all currently-initialized framing nodes — read by `[FComposableCameraShotZoneOverlay](../structs/FComposableCameraShotZoneOverlay.md#fcomposablecamerashotzoneoverlay)` (the LS / PIE viewport `CCS.Debug.Viewport.ShotZones` overlay) so it can paint anchor + zone gizmos for every active Shot regardless of whether the host camera is on the PCM context stack or owned by an LS Component.

Ownership: each instance adds itself in `OnInitialize` and removes itself in `BeginDestroy`. `TWeakObjectPtr` keys ensure GC'd nodes silently drop out of iteration without needing manual cleanup.

Cost: a single static `TSet` insert/remove per camera lifecycle boundary; iteration cost is paid only when the overlay CVar is on. Compiled out in shipping.

| `float` | [`LastPrimaryDistance`](#lastprimarydistance)  | Last frame's effective `Placement.Distance` (post-damping + post-clamp) for the primary shot. `< 0` ⇒ no prior — solver skips Distance damping on the next tick and uses the authored value. Cached together with the pose because both share the same activation / Section-boundary lifecycle. |
| `float` | [`LastPrimaryFOV`](#lastprimaryfov)  | Last frame's effective FOV / Roll for the primary shot — sentinel semantics match `FShotPriorPose::LastFOV` / `LastRoll`: `LastPrimaryFOV < 0` ⇒ no prior; `LastPrimaryRoll == FLT_MAX` ⇒ no prior. Solver skips the corresponding damping on the next tick when the prior is absent. |
| `float` | [`LastPrimaryRoll`](#lastprimaryroll)  |  |

| `TObjectPtr< UComposableCameraTransitionDataAsset >` | [`ActiveBlendTransition`](#activeblendtransition)  | Resolved EnterTransition asset for the active two-Shot blend. Set by `SetActiveShotsFromSequencer`. Null indicates hard cut — F.4 treats this as "secondary Shot is unused" and runs only the primary solver path. |
| `float` | [`ActiveBlendAlpha`](#activeblendalpha)  | Secondary's contribution weight ∈ [0, 1] for the active blend. 0 = primary fully dominant; 1 = secondary fully dominant. |
| `float` | [`ExternalAspectRatioOverride`](#externalaspectratiooverride)  | Push-from-LSComponent override for the solver's `ViewportAspectRatio`. Honors CineCam's `bConstrainAspectRatio` (filmback-derived) vs unconstrained (live viewport size, including editor scrub via the `[FGetActiveEditorViewport](../structs/FGetActiveEditorViewport.md#fgetactiveeditorviewport)` hook). 0 = no override, fall back to `GetEffectiveViewportAspectRatio(OwningPlayerCameraManager)`. |

#### LocalFrameCounter { #localframecounter }

```cpp
int32 LocalFrameCounter = 0
```

Per-instance frame counter for the `Periodic` bounds-cache policy. Reset in OnInitialize, incremented at the end of every OnTickNode. `[EBoundsCachePolicy::Live](#ComposableCameraShotTarget_8h_1a8e6b3060b0f99d10653877e1989d03aba955ad3298db330b5ee880c2c9e6f23a0)` ignores this; `StaticSnapshot` doesn't touch the cache after OnInitialize.

---

#### bHasLastPrimaryOutputPose { #bhaslastprimaryoutputpose }

```cpp
bool bHasLastPrimaryOutputPose = false
```

True iff `LastPrimaryOutputPose` carries a valid prior solve. False = next tick performs a V1 hard solve and seeds the cache.

---

#### LastPrimaryOutputPosition { #lastprimaryoutputposition }

```cpp
FVector LastPrimaryOutputPosition = FVector::ZeroVector
```

Position + rotation produced by the most recent successful primary solve. Read by the next tick to project Aim/Placement anchors when the corresponding zones are enabled. Only Position + Rotation are cached because the Solver re-derives FOV / Focus from the current frame's context regardless.

---

#### LastPrimaryOutputRotation { #lastprimaryoutputrotation }

```cpp
FRotator LastPrimaryOutputRotation = FRotator::ZeroRotator
```

---

#### LastPrimaryDistance { #lastprimarydistance }

```cpp
float LastPrimaryDistance = -1.f
```

Last frame's effective `Placement.Distance` (post-damping + post-clamp) for the primary shot. `< 0` ⇒ no prior — solver skips Distance damping on the next tick and uses the authored value. Cached together with the pose because both share the same activation / Section-boundary lifecycle.

---

#### LastPrimaryFOV { #lastprimaryfov }

```cpp
float LastPrimaryFOV = -1.f
```

Last frame's effective FOV / Roll for the primary shot — sentinel semantics match `FShotPriorPose::LastFOV` / `LastRoll`: `LastPrimaryFOV < 0` ⇒ no prior; `LastPrimaryRoll == FLT_MAX` ⇒ no prior. Solver skips the corresponding damping on the next tick when the prior is absent.

---

#### LastPrimaryRoll { #lastprimaryroll }

```cpp
float LastPrimaryRoll = TNumericLimits<float>::Max()
```

---

#### bHasLastSecondaryOutputPose { #bhaslastsecondaryoutputpose }

```cpp
float LastSecondaryRoll = TNumericLimits<float>::Max()
```

---

#### bHasSecondaryShot { #bhassecondaryshot }

```cpp
bool bHasSecondaryShot = false
```

True iff a secondary (incoming) Shot is currently active for blend. When false the node behaves as V1: Shot is the sole solver input.

---

#### SecondaryShot { #secondaryshot }

```cpp
FComposableCameraShot SecondaryShot
```

Phase F secondary Shot — the higher-row (incoming) section's effective Shot. Only consumed when `bHasSecondaryShot` is true and `ActiveBlendTransition` is non-null.

---

#### ActiveBlendTransition { #activeblendtransition }

```cpp
TObjectPtr< UComposableCameraTransitionDataAsset > ActiveBlendTransition
```

Resolved EnterTransition asset for the active two-Shot blend. Set by `SetActiveShotsFromSequencer`. Null indicates hard cut — F.4 treats this as "secondary Shot is unused" and runs only the primary solver path.

---

#### ActiveBlendAlpha { #activeblendalpha }

```cpp
float ActiveBlendAlpha = 0.0f
```

Secondary's contribution weight ∈ [0, 1] for the active blend. 0 = primary fully dominant; 1 = secondary fully dominant.

---

#### ExternalAspectRatioOverride { #externalaspectratiooverride }

```cpp
float ExternalAspectRatioOverride = 0.f
```

Push-from-LSComponent override for the solver's `ViewportAspectRatio`. Honors CineCam's `bConstrainAspectRatio` (filmback-derived) vs unconstrained (live viewport size, including editor scrub via the `[FGetActiveEditorViewport](../structs/FGetActiveEditorViewport.md#fgetactiveeditorviewport)` hook). 0 = no override, fall back to `GetEffectiveViewportAspectRatio(OwningPlayerCameraManager)`.
