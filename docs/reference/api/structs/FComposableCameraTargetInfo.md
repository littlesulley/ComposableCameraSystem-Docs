# FComposableCameraTargetInfo { #fcomposablecameratargetinfo }

```cpp
#include <ComposableCameraTargetInfo.h>
```

Identifies a single world-frame point on (or near) an Actor — the "pivot" that camera nodes resolve to a world position each frame.

Phase A consumers (V1.x): FocusPullNode, OcclusionFadeNode — both call [ResolveWorldPoint()](#resolveworldpoint) instead of duplicating the same bone-walk-and-fallback logic inline. The other two pivot-using nodes (CollisionPushNode, ScreenSpacePivotNode) keep their own resolution code in V1: CollisionPush caches a SkeletalMeshComponent on activation for hot-path speed; ScreenSpacePivot has no bone path at all (it's just ActorLocation + WorldUpOffset). They may adopt this struct later if and when there's a win.

Phase B+ consumers: the Shot composition system (see Docs/ShotBasedKeyframing.md) — used directly inside FShotTarget and resolved via the Composition Solver.

Resolution proceeds in two paths:

1. Bone path (bUseBoneAsPivot && BoneName valid): walk Actor's SkeletalMeshComponents, pick the first whose skeleton has a socket / bone named BoneName. Pivot base = socket world location, pivot frame rotation = socket world quaternion.

1. Actor path (bUseBoneAsPivot is false, OR the bone path failed): pivot base = Actor->GetActorLocation(), pivot frame rotation = Actor->GetActorQuat().

Then Offset is added on top: in world space if bOffsetInLocalSpace is false (default — matches the legacy "world Z offset" semantics that existing pivot-using nodes pass through), or rotated through the pivot frame quaternion first if bOffsetInLocalSpace is true.

Properties are BlueprintReadOnly per Docs/ShotBasedKeyframing.md §1.4 — Shot data is designer-authored content, not gameplay-controlled state. The struct is BlueprintType for editor / Sequencer / Details panel reflection only.

### Public Attributes

| Return | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `TSoftObjectPtr< AActor >` | [`Actor`](#actor)  | The actor whose pivot this struct describes. Soft-referenced so the Details-panel actor picker can span LEVEL actors from any world — the containing UAsset (Camera Type Asset, future Shot Asset) is not bound to a specific Level, so a hard `TObjectPtr<AActor>` would only allow picking persistent / package-scoped actors and silently fail for level-instance actors. `TSoftObjectPtr` matches the workflow used by BlackEyeCameras' `FBlackEyeSimpleTarget::Actor` for the same reason. |
| `bool` | [`bUseBoneAsPivot`](#buseboneaspivot)  | When true, BoneName resolves on Actor's skeletal mesh and that bone / socket location is used as the pivot base. When false, Actor's location is used. Offset is added on top of either. |
| `FName` | [`BoneName`](#bonename)  | Bone or socket on Actor's skeletal mesh. Used iff bUseBoneAsPivot. |
| `FVector` | [`Offset`](#offset-1)  | Vector offset added to whichever pivot base is resolved. Default zero reproduces "no offset"; (0, 0, Z) reproduces the legacy "world-Z offset" pattern that existing pivot-using nodes pass through. |
| `bool` | [`bOffsetInLocalSpace`](#boffsetinlocalspace)  | When true, Offset is rotated through the resolved pivot's local frame before being added — bone's socket quaternion in bone path, actor's quaternion in actor path. When false (default), Offset is added directly in world space — matches the legacy "PivotZOffset" semantics that existing FocusPullNode / OcclusionFadeNode authors expect when their call sites construct an [FComposableCameraTargetInfo](#fcomposablecameratargetinfo) via the Phase A migration. |
| `bool` | [`bUseSkeletalMeshForwardAsBasis`](#buseskeletalmeshforwardasbasis)  | When true, AND the resolved Actor has at least one SkeletalMeshComponent, the **anchor basis** the Composition Solver uses for camera-relative placement (Shot's `Placement.BasisFrame == InheritFromActor` mode) is read from the SkelMesh component's world quaternion instead of the Actor's quaternion. |

#### Actor { #actor }

```cpp
TSoftObjectPtr< AActor > Actor
```

The actor whose pivot this struct describes. Soft-referenced so the Details-panel actor picker can span LEVEL actors from any world — the containing UAsset (Camera Type Asset, future Shot Asset) is not bound to a specific Level, so a hard `TObjectPtr<AActor>` would only allow picking persistent / package-scoped actors and silently fail for level-instance actors. `TSoftObjectPtr` matches the workflow used by BlackEyeCameras' `FBlackEyeSimpleTarget::Actor` for the same reason.

Resolution to a live `AActor*` happens lazily via `Actor.Get()` inside `ResolveWorldPoint` — returns the loaded actor if currently in memory, nullptr otherwise (no force-load on the hot path).

---

#### bUseBoneAsPivot { #buseboneaspivot }

```cpp
bool bUseBoneAsPivot = false
```

When true, BoneName resolves on Actor's skeletal mesh and that bone / socket location is used as the pivot base. When false, Actor's location is used. Offset is added on top of either.

---

#### BoneName { #bonename }

```cpp
FName BoneName
```

Bone or socket on Actor's skeletal mesh. Used iff bUseBoneAsPivot.

---

#### Offset { #offset-1 }

```cpp
FVector Offset = FVector::ZeroVector
```

Vector offset added to whichever pivot base is resolved. Default zero reproduces "no offset"; (0, 0, Z) reproduces the legacy "world-Z offset" pattern that existing pivot-using nodes pass through.

---

#### bOffsetInLocalSpace { #boffsetinlocalspace }

```cpp
bool bOffsetInLocalSpace = false
```

When true, Offset is rotated through the resolved pivot's local frame before being added — bone's socket quaternion in bone path, actor's quaternion in actor path. When false (default), Offset is added directly in world space — matches the legacy "PivotZOffset" semantics that existing FocusPullNode / OcclusionFadeNode authors expect when their call sites construct an [FComposableCameraTargetInfo](#fcomposablecameratargetinfo) via the Phase A migration.

---

#### bUseSkeletalMeshForwardAsBasis { #buseskeletalmeshforwardasbasis }

```cpp
bool bUseSkeletalMeshForwardAsBasis = false
```

When true, AND the resolved Actor has at least one SkeletalMeshComponent, the **anchor basis** the Composition Solver uses for camera-relative placement (Shot's `Placement.BasisFrame == InheritFromActor` mode) is read from the SkelMesh component's world quaternion instead of the Actor's quaternion.

Why this exists: UE's `ACharacter` defaults the `Mesh` SkeletalMeshComponent to `RelativeRotation = (0, -90, 0)` so the DCC-authored character (typically faces local +Y or -Y by Maya / Max convention) visually faces the actor's world +X (the gameplay forward axis used by `GetActorForwardVector`, MovementComponent, AI). With this flag false, `LocalCameraDirection=(0,0)` places the camera along "actor +X" — correct relative to gameplay forward, but offset by 90° relative to the **visible** mesh forward (which faces actor +Y). With this flag true, the basis is read from the mesh component's world quat — `LocalCameraDirection=(0,0)` then places the camera in front of the visual forward, matching designer expectation for character-style subjects.

Has no effect when:

* Shot's `Placement.BasisFrame == World` (basis is forced identity).

* This Target isn't the SingleTarget anchor (basis isn't queried).

* Resolved Actor has no SkeletalMeshComponent (silently falls back to the actor quat — same as if the flag were false).

Default `false` to preserve V1.x behavior for existing assets. Toggle to true for Character-style targets when authoring new Shots.

Independent of `bUseBoneAsPivot` / `BoneName`: this flag drives the BASIS for camera placement; those drive the PIVOT POINT for the camera to look at. Different concerns, separately authored.

### Public Methods

| Return | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `bool` | [`ResolveWorldPoint`](#resolveworldpoint) `const` | Resolves to a single world-frame point following the path described in the struct comment. Returns false when Actor is null; OutPoint is left unchanged on failure so callers can pre-seed it. |
| `bool` | [`ResolveBasisQuat`](#resolvebasisquat) `const` | Resolves the basis quaternion this target contributes to the Composition Solver's `ResolvePlacementBasis` step (when the Shot's `Placement.BasisFrame == InheritFromActor` and this target is referenced by `Placement.BasisActorIndex`). See `[ComposableCameraShotSolver.h](#composablecamerashotsolverh)` for how the result enters the `LocalCameraDirection` rotation chain. |

---

#### ResolveWorldPoint { #resolveworldpoint }

`const`

```cpp
bool ResolveWorldPoint(FVector & OutPoint, bool * OutUsedBone) const
```

Resolves to a single world-frame point following the path described in the struct comment. Returns false when Actor is null; OutPoint is left unchanged on failure so callers can pre-seed it.

Bone-path failure (bUseBoneAsPivot true but no SkeletalMeshComponent on Actor has the requested socket / bone) is silent: falls through to the actor path and still returns true. Same fallback the inline implementations had before consolidation.

**Parameters**

* `OutPoint` Resolved world-frame point. Left unchanged on failure (Actor null). 

* `OutUsedBone` Optional. When non-null, set to true iff the bone path resolved successfully (bUseBoneAsPivot was true AND BoneName was found on a SkelMesh). Set to false in every other case (no bone mode, fallback fired, or Actor null). Used by the V1.x migration call sites in FocusPullNode / OcclusionFadeNode to preserve the legacy "Z
                    offset is applied only when the bone path did
                    NOT resolve" semantic — see the call sites in those nodes for the exact pattern.

Composition Solver / Shot data callers typically pass nullptr (default) — they treat Offset as always-applied regardless of which resolution path fired, which is the cleaner contract for forward-looking authored content.

---

#### ResolveBasisQuat { #resolvebasisquat }

`const`

```cpp
bool ResolveBasisQuat(FQuat & OutQuat) const
```

Resolves the basis quaternion this target contributes to the Composition Solver's `ResolvePlacementBasis` step (when the Shot's `Placement.BasisFrame == InheritFromActor` and this target is referenced by `Placement.BasisActorIndex`). See `[ComposableCameraShotSolver.h](#composablecamerashotsolverh)` for how the result enters the `LocalCameraDirection` rotation chain.

Path:

1. Soft-resolve `Actor.Get()` and PIE-remap (same path as `ResolveWorldPoint` — captures live PIE-instance quat instead of editor-world authoring quat).

1. If `bUseSkeletalMeshForwardAsBasis` AND the actor has at least one `USkeletalMeshComponent` → return that component's world quat (`GetComponentQuat()`). For UE`ACharacter` this picks up the conventional `(0, -90, 0)` mesh offset that aligns visual forward to actor +X.

1. Otherwise → return `Actor->GetActorQuat()`.

Returns false when the actor is null (`OutQuat` left unchanged so callers can pre-seed it to `FQuat::Identity`).
