#### OnBeginPlay_Implementation { #onbeginplay_implementation-3 }

`virtual`

```cpp
virtual void OnBeginPlay_Implementation(float DeltaTime, const FComposableCameraPose & CurrentSourcePose, const FComposableCameraPose & CurrentTargetPose)
```

---

#### OnEvaluate_Implementation { #onevaluate_implementation-8 }

`virtual`

```cpp
virtual FComposableCameraPose OnEvaluate_Implementation(float DeltaTime, const FComposableCameraPose & CurrentSourcePose, const FComposableCameraPose & CurrentTargetPose)
```

#### GetBlendWeightAt { #getblendweightat-6 }

`virtual` `const`

```cpp
virtual float GetBlendWeightAt(float NormalizedTime) const
```

Evaluate the transition's timing curve at a given normalized progress in [0, 1]. Returns the blend weight this transition would apply at that progress — i.e. the shape of its Percentage-over-duration curve.

Used exclusively by the debug panel to render a sparkline preview of the blend curve on top of the transition's progress bar. The call site is a one-per-frame-per-active-transition sample loop, so the implementation must stay cheap (no allocations, no state reads that mutate). NOT used on the runtime evaluation hot path — real blend weight is still derived from `Percentage` in `OnEvaluate` so that per-transition state (polynomials, curves, etc.) keeps driving it.

Default implementation returns the input unchanged, giving a linear diagonal — the right fallback for transitions whose concept of "blend weight" isn't a simple scalar of normalized time (Inertialized position path, for example, is a polynomial trajectory, not a scalar lerp; showing a diagonal there still reads as "progress = time" which is accurate for its rotational / overall progression).

Concrete overrides should be pure math — no reads of `RemainingTime`, `TransitionTime`, or any internal state. Use only the `NormalizedTime` argument plus the transition's authored UPROPERTYs (Exp, bSmootherStep, EvaluationCurveType, etc.).

#### DrawTransitionDebug { #drawtransitiondebug-7 }

`virtual` `const`

```cpp
virtual void DrawTransitionDebug(UWorld * World, bool bViewerIsOutsideCamera) const
```

Per-transition world-space debug hook.

Invoked from `[UComposableCameraEvaluationTree::DrawTransitionsDebug](../core/UComposableCameraEvaluationTree.md#drawtransitionsdebug)` while `CCS.Debug.Viewport` is on, once per frame for every transition that currently sits in an Inner node of the active director's tree (and, recursively, of any referenced director's tree — inter-context blends see both sides).

Default implementation is empty. Concrete transitions override, check their own `CCS.Debug.Viewport.Transitions.<Name>` CVar, and usually call `DrawStandardTransitionDebug` plus any type-specific extras (spline curve sample, feeler rays, etc.).

**Parameters**

* `World` World to draw into. Routes through the world's LineBatcher, so the draw is visible in every viewport that renders this world (game + F8-ejected editor). 

* `bViewerIsOutsideCamera` True when the player is NOT viewing through the camera (F8 eject / SIE). Overrides use this to skip gizmos that would occlude the near plane — mostly the source/target frustum pyramids.

Compiled out in shipping builds.
